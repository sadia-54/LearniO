# 📚 LearniO AI  

LearniO AI is a **cloud-hosted SaaS web application** designed to **supercharge learning** with AI-powered goal planning, daily tasks, quizzes, progress tracking, feedback, and email reminders.  

This project is **my own idea** 💡 — I first created a **prototype in Visily AI**, then built the full application using modern web technologies.  
The site is **fully responsive**, so you can plan and track your learning journey on **any device, anytime**.
